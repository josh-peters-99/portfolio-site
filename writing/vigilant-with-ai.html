        <h2 class="page-title">Being Vigilant with AI</h2>
        <p>
            As a new computer science graduate, I am being extremely vigilant about the ways in which I use AI.
            I am a strong believer that the only way to 
            become better at something is by actually doing that thing. Whether that be playing a sport, 
            speaking a new language, learning how to cook, etc. The same principle applies to programming. 
            In order to become a better programmer, you HAVE TO program. Offloading all the heavy lifting to 
            AI will not make you a better programmer. And as good as AI is, there is always the possiblity 
            that it will make a mistake. That is where you, as the programmer, need to know what is going on 
            so that you will have the capability to fix the error. If you lack the experience and knowledge 
            to thoroughly understand the code the AI generates, then how can you expect to fix issues that 
            may arise? The path to obtaining the necessary experience and knowledge takes patiences and 
            practice. I have set the follwoing rule for my AI usage:
            <br><br>
            <b>If I don't know how to do it myself, I'm not using AI.</b>
            <br><br>
            Could this be extreme? Yes. But as someone who recently graduated from college, I feel I still 
            lack a lot of experience that must be obtained through trial and error. Of course, I am aware and 
            know that AI will be used in most software engineering positions so I'm not isolating myself from 
            it completely. I still think it is essential to know how to use the tool. But at this point in my 
            progression as a programmer, I am going to stick with using it as more of a time saver for completing 
            tasks and solving problems I already know how to solve rather than having it write all the code 
            for me. 
            <br><br>
            I'm not here to beat down AI. I believe it is an incredibly innovative technology that has many 
            use cases. But like every tool, there are times to use it and times to refrain from using it.
