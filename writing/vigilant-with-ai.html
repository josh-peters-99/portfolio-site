        <h2 class="page-title">Being Vigilant with AI</h2>
        <p class="date">July 16, 2025</p>
        <p>
            When I was first experimenting with AI, I thought it was the greatest invention ever! I would use AI to help me write 
            every coding project I was working on. It saved me so much time. It became a habbit that once I sat down to code, I would 
            automatically open a tab with ChatGPT or Grok to have on standby whenever I wanted to use it. Eventually, for every 
            problem I encountered while coding (even the small ones), rather than trying to resolve the issue using my own brain, I 
            would ask AI for the solution. After heavily using AI for two years, I am stepping away from it. Not completely, but as 
            a new computer science graduate I am intent on being extremely vigilant about the ways in which I use AI.
            <br><br>
            Let me reiterate that I am not going to stop using AI completely. I am aware that it is an extremely useful tool and 
            is widely used in the software engineering industry. However, I feel that I still lack a significant amount of knowledge 
            and experience to be using AI as frequently as I was. Therefore, I have established the following rule for myself:
            <br><br>
            <b>
                If I do not have the knowledge and experience to solve a particular problem and write the necessary code, I will 
                NOT use AI.
            </b>
            <br><br>
            I am a strong believer that the path to becoming an expert at something is simple - practice doing that thing. 
            Whether it's a sport, cooking, learning a new language, a musical instrument...whatever skill you want to aquire will 
            require that you spend a significant amount of time practicing that skill. Programming is no different and when AI is 
            frequently used to solve every challenge you encounter as a programmer, you will never reach the level of expertice 
            needed to become a legitimate software engineer.
            <br><br>
            This is the primary reason why I have decided to significantly cut back on my usage of AI. Having just graduated 
            from college, I don't have years of professional software engineering experience. If I continue to utilize AI like 
            I have in the past then it's obvious that I will never obtain the skills and experience I so badly desire.
